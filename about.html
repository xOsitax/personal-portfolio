          <h3>Programming</h3>
          <p>
            I went to a vocational highschool, I took a Computer System
            Technology (CST) class, instead of the usual Art or Theater classes.
            In that class I learned all about the field of Information
            Technology (IT). I gained the skills to build computers and
            troubleshoot computer issues, as well as, set up networks and
            maintain them.
          </p>
          <p>
            In my junior year, in that CST class, I learned about the Python
            programming language. Immediately, I was hooked with being able to
            write programs and see them run. From that moment on I decided that
            I wanted to learn more, which took me down the path of Computer
            Science.

          <h3>Soccer</h3>
          <p>
            In Peru, two sports dominated over everything else: Soccer and
            Volleyball. At the age of 4 with the encouragement of my father, I
            began playing soccer for a small team in a minor league meant for
            children ages 4-7. My father was a fanatic of soccer, so it was only
            natural that he would want me to play as well.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thanks to my father, soccer became a big part of who I am. Whenever
            the weather is good enough you can be sure that I'll be at the
            soccer field. Soccer not only makes me happy, it also helps me stay
            in shape, especially with the amount of food I can eat.

            My father would tell me stories of the places he had travel to
            during his 20s. In particular, the United States and Japan were two
            places he had lived in for years. Through his tales, I started to
            become curious about foreign countries and their cultures.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thanks to my father, I feel in love with learning new languages and
            learning about the lifestyles that people would lead in those
            countries. If I ever have the opportunity, there are 3 places I
            would want to live in for a couple of years: Japan, South Korea, and
            Germany.
